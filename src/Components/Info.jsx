                At MVGDC, we learn how to develop video games from scratch using Unity, a cross-platform game engine. By the end of the school year, we hope to publish a video game together, and even participate in the Ludum Dare Game Jam, an online competition where games are made from scratch in a span of three days. No previous experience is necessary to join, and everything will be taught from the very beginning.
